        <h1>The Cheesus Crust</h1>
         <p>It's not just a grilled cheese.
            It's a <em>Cheesus Crust.</em> 
            The finest, most decadent, special occasion
            sandwich meal that makes angels weep.
        </p>
         <p>Lets get Cheesy.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Bread. <em>Breads,</em> even. Two slices. 
                    Three if you're gangsta like that.</li>
                <li>Bacon</li>
                <li>More butter than you need, 
                    just slightly less than you want</li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
                <li>Parsley and Oregano</li>
                <li>Red Pesto</li>
                <li>Cheddar <em>AND</em> Mozzarella</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>How to make the magic</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Chop up and fry a good amount of greasy bacon.
                    Put the meat aside and save the grease. Lower the heat.
                </li>
                <li>Melt a portion of your butter, 
                    add crushed garlic & herbs</li>
                <li>Generously layer some butter 
                    onto one side of the bread</li>
                <li>layer some pesto, bacon and 
                    cheese on the other slice(s)</li>
                <li>Assemble the sandwich with the buttered side facing outwards</li>
                <li>Raise the pan's heat and place the sandwich buttered side down</li>
                <li>brush the other side of the bread liberally with your compound butter mix</li>
                <li>once the bottom side has toasted and no longer sticks, flip the sandwich over and repeat step 7</li>
            </ol>
        <p>You now have a sandwich fit for royalty, 
            enough calories to take you through winter, 
            and a food coma that will send you straight to sweet dreams.</p>
