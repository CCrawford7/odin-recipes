In this exercise I will be creating a mockup of
a very basic recipe website in html, using what I have learnt so far in the Foundations element of The Odin Project. 

After a few attempts, I've successfully completed this project as well as added some personal creative flair. I've experimented with using different tags to make a more dynamic reading experience, but I have had some trouble keeping track of file directories and this has pushed progress back somewhat. I've also had trouble learning the correct methodology for committing on projects effectively, but I will aim to rectify both of these issues as I progress through the course. 

I'm getting a lot more confident in navigating around Linux, despite running the OS through a VM, I'm more or less primarily using it on this device and hope to do a full native install on my laptop as soon as I feel able to.
